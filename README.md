## Overview

Cyberscape is designed to be a vibrant and engaging theme, perfect for those who enjoy the process of building personal websites.

## Install

To get started with Cyberscape, use the following command:

```
git submodule add https://github.com/isaksolheim/cyberscape themes/cyberscape
```

Then, open `config.toml` and change the `theme` to `"cyberscape"`:

```
theme = "cyberscape"
```

Navigate to the themes directory and install dependencies:

```
cd themes/cyberscape
npm i
```

## A Note on Tailwind

Cyberscape uses Tailwind CSS for styling. To ensure styles are up to date during development, run the following command from the themes directory:

```
npm run watch
```

This command will compile your Tailwind CSS as you make changes, keeping your development process smooth and streamlined.

The `tailwind.config.js` comes configured like the following:

```
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: ["content/**/*.md", "layouts/**/*.html", "../../content/**/*.md"],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```

If you wish to write Tailwind in any additional directories, add their relative path from the config file to the `content` field.
